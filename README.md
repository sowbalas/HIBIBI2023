# HIBIBI2023
Code for brain network similarity using k cores for HIBIBI2023
To execute the code, it is necessary to modify both the directory location and the matsize for each dataset. In the "tdDirectory" and "asdDirectory" variables, the dataset location for TD (Typically Developing) and ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) files should be specified, respectively. For datasets related to children, male individuals, with eyes closed, and adolescents, the matsize should be set to 116, while for the ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) dataset, the matsize should be set to 190.
